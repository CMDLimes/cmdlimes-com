    description : >
      Our co-op is owned by the people closest to the business, not distant investors. We respect everyone's opinion thus our governing body is democratically elected. While bureaucracy and treachery are minimal, our community is driven by those who care deeply about the community and for the benefit of everyone. We care for each other, and we care strongly about diversity, inclusivity, equality and accessibility.

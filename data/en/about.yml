    title : We are a Co-op, we are a community
    description : >
      Co-ops are owned by the people closest to the business, not distant investors only interested in a financial return. We respect everyone's opinion thus our governing body is democratically elected. While bureaucracy and treachery are minimal, our community is driven by those who care deeply about the community and for the benefit of everyone. We care for each other, but we also care about diversity, inclusivity, equality and accessibility.

    title : We are underrepresented
    description : >
      We are the underdog of the tech industry, not because of our abilities, but because of social stereotypes and bias. We empower underrepresented folks to break this boundary and to show the world we are just as good given the right environment. We nurture future talents in underrepresented communities to become future leaders of the industry.
